# personal-website
Repository for my personal website, live at [rishimo.co](https://rishimo.co). 

Hosted on DigitalOcean, domain through Google.

HTML and CSS largely by me, using bootstrap 4.3.1 default stylesheet as a foundation.

Credit to [marcbruederlin](https://github.com/marcbruederlin) for his fantastic [particles.js](https://github.com/marcbruederlin/particles.js) script.

Credit to the team behind [barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) for their excellent page transition framework.

todo, rough priorities order:
- shorten transitions / improve usability
- finish about page
- create projects page, develop scaffold for collapsible project information
- create experience page, 'interactive' resume with actual resume pdf available
- change hobbies page to PORTFOLIO, explore lightbox js libraries to develop library
